<p class="teaser">One promise of open data is that it will help us to find new ways to understand and respond to the world we live in. This is a big promise, but we want to find modest and meaningful ways to make good on it.</p>
<p class="teaser">We’ve decided to start a series of week-long sprints, convening small teams of domain experts, data wranglers and developers to create useful data-driven applications that help to answer questions and unpack issues in a variety of different areas.</p>

<h2>Planned Sprints</h2>

<h2>Why have sprints?</h2>

<p>To make a good application that will inform and support policy-making, a wide range of skills are needed: people who understand the issues and challenges, people who understand the data and those who know how to put things together in an app that is both meaningful and visually attractive.</p>

<p>At the same time, we want to encourage our team to choose a realistic goal: an application that can be finished and polished in a single week, with a team of five. To accomplish this, we’ll lock ourselves into a shared space for this time and to fully focus on making.</p>
