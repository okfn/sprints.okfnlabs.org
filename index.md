title: OKFN Labs Energy Sprint
---

<p class="teaser">One promise of open data is that it will help us to find new ways to look at the world we live in, to highlight and explain policy options. This is a big promise, but we want to find humble and meaningful ways to make good on it. Weâ€™ve decided to start a series of experiments in which a small team with diverse backgrounds will work for a week-long sprint to tackle a policy question and produce a simple data-driven application to help us find answers.</p>

<p>The first such challenge should be around the theme of <strong>energy</strong>: renewable energy resources and energy efficiency, fossil fuels and traditional energy structures, electricity demand and supply, government spending around energy policies as well as emissions from energy use in transport, industry, etc.</p>

<p>Organisations that are working in this area are invited to partner with OKFN Labs on presenting a challenge for our team. The partners are expected to provide some support in the process of framing the Energy Lab and present an input in the form of a presentation about current research, policy and technological gaps.</p>

<p>Please contact us with a short e-mail, outlining the challenge in answering the following questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the problem you would like to solve?</li>
  <li>Which are the groups and relevant audiences?</li>
  <li>What kind of data would you like to use?</li>
</ul>
