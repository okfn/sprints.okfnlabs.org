  OKFN Labs Sprints

<p class="teaser">One promise of open data is that it will help us to find new ways to look at the world we live in, to highlight and explain policy options. This is a big promise, but we want to find humble and meaningful ways to make good on it. We’ve decided to start a series of experiments in which a small team from diverse backgrounds will work for a week-long sprint and tackle a policy question to produce a simple data-driven application to explain the issue.</p>

<h2>Why have sprints?</h2>

<p>To make a good web app that will inform and support policy-making, a wide range of skills are needed: people who understand the issues and challenges, people who understand the data and those who know how to put things together in an app that is both meaningful and visually attractive.</p>

<p>At the same time, we want to encourage our team to choose a realistic goal: an application that can be finished and polished in a single week, with a team of five. To accomplish this, we’ll lock ourselves into a shared space for this time and to fully focus on making.</p>
