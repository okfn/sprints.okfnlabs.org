  Energy Sprint
  <small>October 1<sup>st</sup>-8<sup>th</sup>, 2012 &mdash; Berlin, Germany.</small>
</h1>

<p class="teaser">Our first sprint will focus on the theme of <strong>energy</strong>. Ensuring a sustainable energy supply
without depleting natural resources and destroying the environment we live in is one of the toughest challenges we face.</p>

<p class="teaser">We need to understand what can be achieved with smart technologies and good policy in order
to produce sustainably, to reduce consumption and to bring down emissions.</p>

<h2>Become our partner</h2>

<p>Organisations that are working in this area are invited to partner with OKFN Labs on presenting a challenge for our team. The partners are expected to provide some support in the process of framing the Energy Lab and present an input in the form of a presentation about current research, policy and technological gaps.</p>

<p>Please contact us with a short e-mail, outlining the challenge in answering the following questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the problem you would like to solve?</li>
  <li>Which are the groups and relevant audiences?</li>
  <li>What kind of data would you like to use?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background: Energy</h2>

<p>Technological progress thrives on better access to information and the energy sector is highly dependent on innovation and better technology. Being one of the most important in economy, the energy sector is also the highest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch1s1-3.html">IPCC 4th Assessment Report)</a>.</p>

<p>Access to energy data and relevant information is a citizen right and governments have a responsibility in providing publicly-owned data in a machine-readable format in order to enable re-use in all sectors of society. Information technology has a key role in the development of more efficient, cleaner and more reliable energy <a href="http://www.reeep.org/LOD-the-Essentials.pdf">sources</a>. Increasingly recognised by governments as <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/07/12/open-data-clean-secure-energy-future">“a powerful input to innovation”</a>, open energy data can empower citizens, create jobs, encourage entrepreneurship and foster societal transformations. As a fuel in the economy, sustainable energy also has the potential <a href="http://www.sustainableenergyforall.org/ ">"to improve the conditions and standard of living for the majority of the world’s population.</a></p>

<p>The link between energy information and data and data-driven sustainability has lead to a number of initiatives, aiming at incubating ideas and supporting smaller applications related to sustainable energy like: <a href="http://en.openei.org/"> the Open Energy Information (OpenEI) </a>: a knowledge sharing online community and <a href="http://www.reegle.info/"> Reegle.info </a>: a clean energy portal with comprehensive country profiles, energy statistics and a directory of relevant actors. We seek inspiration and partners with other relevant clean energy organisations who do open data projects and we welcome ideas and challenges.</p>

<p>The value of open energy data Original energy data apps could assist users in forecasting future consumption based on previous usage data, mapping daily electricity consumption peaks and lows, providing web-based tools for emissions data-collection, comparing the efficiency and cost of alternative energy investments or presenting data in an easy-to-understand, interactive and engaging way.</p>

<p>While many sustability hackdays and open data challenges result in many good ideas and a few half-ready apps, our aim is to have an app ready at the end of the week-long sprint.</p>
