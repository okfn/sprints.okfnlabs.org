  Energy Sprint
  <small>October 1<sup>st</sup>-8<sup>th</sup>, 2012 &mdash; Berlin, Germany.</small>
</h1>

<p class="teaser">One promise of open data is that it will help us to find new ways to look at the world we live in, to highlight and explain policy options. This is a big promise, but we want to find humble and meaningful ways to make good on it. We’ve decided to start <a href="/">a series of experiments</a> in which a small team from diverse backgrounds will work for a week-long sprint and tackle a policy question to produce a simple data-driven application to explain the issue.</p>

<p>The first challenge will focus on a theme of <strong>energy</strong>: renewable energy resources and energy efficiency, fossil fuels and traditional energy structures, electricity demand and supply, government spending around energy policies as well as emissions from energy use in transport, industry, etc.</p>

<h2>Become our partner</h2>

<p>Organisations that are working in this area are invited to partner with OKFN Labs on presenting a challenge for our team. The partners are expected to provide some support in the process of framing the Energy Lab and present an input in the form of a presentation about current research, policy and technological gaps.</p>

<p>Please contact us with a short e-mail, outlining the challenge in answering the following questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the problem you would like to solve?</li>
  <li>Which are the groups and relevant audiences?</li>
  <li>What kind of data would you like to use?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background: Energy</h2>

<p>Technological progress thrives on better access to information and the energy sector is highly dependent on innovation and better technology. Being one of the most important in economy, the energy sector is also the highest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions [IPCC source].</p>

<p>In announcing 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy, the UN General Assembly recognised that “…access to modern affordable energy services in developing countries is essential for the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and sustainable development, which would help to reduce poverty and to improve the conditions and standard of living for the majority of the world’s population.</p>

<p>Access to energy data and relevant information is a citizen right and where governments have a responsibility in providing publicly-owned data in a machine-readable format in order to enable re-use in all sectors of society. Information technology has a key role in the development of more efficient, cleaner and more reliable energy sources.</p>

<p>Original energy data apps could assist users in forecasting future consumption based on previous usage data, mapping daily electricity consumption peaks and lows, providing web-based tools for emissions data-collection, comparing the efficiency and cost of alternative energy investments or presenting data in an easy-to-understand, interactive and engaging way. The options are endless…</p>
