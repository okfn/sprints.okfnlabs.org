  Energy Sprint
  <small>October 1<sup>st</sup>-8<sup>th</sup>, 2012 &mdash; Berlin, Germany.</small>
</h1>

<p class="teaser">Our first sprint will focus on the theme of <strong>energy</strong>. Ensuring a sustainable energy supply
without depleting natural resources and destroying the environment we live in is one of the toughest challenges we face.</p>

<p class="teaser">We need to understand what can be achieved with smart technologies and good policy in order
to produce sustainably, to reduce consumption and to bring down emissions.</p>

<h2>Become our partner</h2>

<p>Organisations that are working in this area are invited to partner with OKFN Labs on presenting a challenge for our team. The partners are expected to provide some support in the process of framing the Energy Lab and present an input in the form of a presentation about current research, policy and technological gaps.</p>

<p>Please contact us with a short e-mail, outlining the challenge in answering the following questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the problem you would like to solve?</li>
  <li>Which are the groups and relevant audiences?</li>
  <li>What kind of data would you like to use?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background: Energy</h2>

<p>Technological progress thrives on better access to information and the energy sector is highly dependent on innovation and better technology. Being one of the most important in economy, the energy sector is also the highest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions [IPCC source].</p>

<p>In announcing 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy, the UN General Assembly recognised that “…access to modern affordable energy services in developing countries is essential for the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and sustainable development, which would help to reduce poverty and to improve the conditions and standard of living for the majority of the world’s population.</p>

<p>Access to energy data and relevant information is a citizen right and where governments have a responsibility in providing publicly-owned data in a machine-readable format in order to enable re-use in all sectors of society. Information technology has a key role in the development of more efficient, cleaner and more reliable energy sources.</p>

<p>Original energy data apps could assist users in forecasting future consumption based on previous usage data, mapping daily electricity consumption peaks and lows, providing web-based tools for emissions data-collection, comparing the efficiency and cost of alternative energy investments or presenting data in an easy-to-understand, interactive and engaging way. The options are endless…</p>
